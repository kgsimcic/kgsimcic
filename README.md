## About Me

<!--
**kgsimcic/kgsimcic** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->

I started out studying mathematics with an emphasis on Data Analytics/Science, so my first job as as a data analyst. It was fun, but it was much more interesting to me to see what I could automate about those reports. Now I am learning to build applications and find new processes to automate.

Languages and Libraries I am familiar with (in order of proficiency): Python (Pandas, Numpy, Dask, Selenium, ), C# (with .NET framework) (EFCore, EntityFramework, Linq, xUnit, Moq), JS, C.

### Projects:
- ðŸ”­ In my free time, Iâ€™m currently working on creating an REST API complete with unit tests, model validation, and error handling (see repo DotNetEnglishP7). 

- At work, I'm currently building a shell script that automates the creation of java API method files by receiving the following inputs: the name of the new API method, tye database the table is located in, the name of the table and schema where the data lies, and the parent directory of the API project. 
It then will retrieve the database structure/column names and types via an odbc connection, and insert the relevant columns to the newly created java files. I have everything written so far except the odbc connection piece (it is currently an input csv file).

### Growth and Career:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking into more information about CI/CD pipelines and system design of computers. Math gives me a good understanding of computer logic, but I have shallow knowledge on the architecture and would like to fix that.

- ðŸ‘¯ I would be interested in learning more about the software development, DevOPs, and Data Engineer career paths -- not sure which to pursue long term.

- ðŸ“« My interests: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (purple belt), video games (Dead by Daylight, anyone?), and painting.
